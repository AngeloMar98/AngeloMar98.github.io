# DIFFERENT PROJECT
I'll try my hand with different project just trying to get the hand of HTML and CSS real good before moving on. For now some ideas are:
- The main page portfolio where I'll test a bunch of new things, even start from scratch if necessary;
- A shop page, whether is beautify products or food;
- A wiki page;
- Some for entarteinment site?
